        "description": "What does your chosen family look like? Do you resonate with Lilo?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker, filmmaker Alan Seawright, and guest Rebecca Parham of @LetMeExplainStudios are reacting to the beloved Lilo and Stitch. It is Rebecca’s favorite movie, and it’s admired by so many for its portrayal of neurodivergent and autistic people. They discuss how Lilo’s neurodivergence makes her unique but misunderstood by her peers and adults. They discuss the emotional burden of having a broken family and how they heal through their shared value of Ohana. Alan praises Chris Sanders for vocalizing Stitch in a way that’s monstrous but also cute, and Rebecca gives credit to the directors for doing their research to accurately represent Hawaii and Hawaiian culture. And, of course, they cry. \n\nThank you to our Patrons for picking this episode!
